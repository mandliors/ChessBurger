# ChessBurger
ChessBurger is a modern chess GUI written in C++.  
The reason I started working on a new chess GUI, is because the GUIs out there are somewhat old and there design/look is quite outdated. So this is why I decided to make a good-looking, feature-rich chess GUI, which is very easy-to-use, but has all the features a chess player needs.  

# Features
-Analysis board  
  -The best move and best lines are shown (engine: Stockfish 14)  
  -Moves are registered, but the user can always go back and do other moves instead.  
-Game room  
  -This is where the user can play against the computer (Stockfish 14)  
  -Time limit is also available  
 
# Plans
There are a lot of further features I am planning to implement, however this project is relatively new, and my time is limited.
Plans:  
  -Multiplayer support  
  -Settings menu  
  -Sounds  
  -Game analysis  
  -etc.  
 
# How to use
